# Emotional 3D Handwriting with Leap Motion
(Adapted from the *Pinchdraw* application by Leap Motion development team. See [here](https://github.com/leapmotion/UnityModules).)

Functions of this app:
- Pinch your index finger and thumb on the right hand and start to draw!
- Let go to stop drawing.
- Pick a style by touching the bricks or pressing num-keys 1-8.
- Erase by touching the 'erasers' next to your left palm, or pressing delete/backspace.
